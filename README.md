# AndroidStrings.dev (Beta)

AndroidStrings.dev is a desktop app (mac, linux, windows) for translating Android `strings.xml` files 🧩

Beta is now avaialble for [download](https://github.com/harteg/androidstrings-ai-releases/releases)! 

It scans your Android project, finds missing or outdated translations, translates them using AI, and writes the results straight back into your `res/values-*` folders. No copy/paste. No external tools.

I built this because I was tired of doing this manually while maintaining my own Android apps like CrookCatcher 🙂

> 🎁 **Free during beta**  
> No API key required. Translations currently use Google Gemini 2.0 Flash.

## Privacy
No personal information and no source code is ever collected or shared. The app only sends crash logs and basic usage statistics so I can keep improving things. Your string content is sent to the AI provider for translation, and nothing else.
